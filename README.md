This project is a Memory Card Game, it aims to show my new acquired skills in JavaScrit and creating a static web page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


# Website Goal

This memory game was created to be simple and easy for kids to play. As a kid I always loved this type of games, so I wanted to create my own version of this game.
When entering the website, you will encounter a "Start Game" overlay. The game consists in matching twelve cards. If you flip the cards and It's a match, the cards will be face up. If It's not a match, the cards will turn back again. After mathcing all cards It's victory.

# Design

My inspiration for this theme is related to one of my favourite holidays, the Halloween, more specifically witches. I wanted to incorporate pastel colors to the website, so I choose lilac for the background and I also wanted the images for the cards to match the aesthetic. When creating the image for the cards I picked a witch cat for the back image. For the front card I choose a pumpkin, a moon, a ghost, a flask of poison, a hat and tarot cards. 
The pictures for the cards were all made in https://www.canva.com/ in the editor mode.  

• **Pastel icons** - The pastel icons were made by @sketchify.

• **Front card background** - The background was made by @shamiss.

• **Front card background** - The cat icon was made by @sparklestroke and the sparkle on the background was made by @amethyststudio,

# Typography

There is only one font families in use on this website. Fredoka one, which I used for the title and the overlay for start game.

# Exsting Features


**Heading**

The heading contains the title of the website. This section is not affected during the game.


**Start Game**

When the player enters the website, he will see a overlay with the text "Start Game". By pressing it, it will reveal the game.


**Matching Cards**

The player will see twelve cards face down, his objective is to find all the matches. When pressing one card, the player will be able to turn another card. 
If the cards don't match, it will turn back again after two seconds. 
If the cards match, it will stay face up to the player.


**Footer**

The website doesn't contain a footer.



# Future Features

The site, presents a fully working memory card game with matching cards. While working on this project, I had other ideas I would like to emplement but these features would add more complexity to the code and take more time to complete.

**Time Remaining and Flips counter**

 • Adding a time remaining would make the game more competitive and more serious. The player would need to match all cards within a certain time or it would be a game over. 

 • Adding a flip counter would allow the player to see how many flips it took to match all cards.

**Sounds**

The sounds would make the website more interactive and more fun to play for the kids.

• Adding a background sound;

• Adding a sound for when cards are flipped;

• Adding a sound for when cards are matched; 


  # Testing
  
  I have used Google Chrome dev tools  and https://ui.dev/amiresponsiveto see how the website would load with different sizes. All images and icons performed as anticipated.
  
  • **Desktop** - Tested on Google Chrome and Firefox browser: All pages and icons worked as anticipated, changing between large, medium and small screens.
  
  • **Mobile** - Tested on https://ui.dev/amiresponsive and used Google Chrome Dev Tools to test other phones, Samsung Galaxy S20 and Pixel 5. All pages, links and icons worked as anticipated.
  
  
  # Validator
  
  • **HTML** - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator: https://validator.w3.org/nu/. There was only a warning regarding lack of heading.
