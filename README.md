This memory game was created to be simple and easy for kids to play. As a kid I always loved this type of games, so I wanted to create my own version of this game.

This project aims to show my new acquired skills in design and create a static web page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


# Design

My inspiration for this theme is related to one of my favourite holidays, the halloween. The pictures for the cards were all made in canvas.com

  • **Desktop** - Tested on Google Chrome and Firefox browser: All pages, links and icons worked as anticipated, changing between large, medium and small screens.
  
  • **Mobile** - Tested on my Iphone12 Pro and used Google Chrome Dev Tools to test other phones, Samsung Galaxy S20 and Pixel 5. All pages, links and icons worked as anticipated.
  
  • **Footer** - Click on icons will open a new browser window associated with the social link.
